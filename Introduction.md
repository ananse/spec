# Introduction

Ananse is a modern implementation of the classic BASIC programming language. It is designed to combine the power of modern high-level programming languages with the simplicity of the classic BASIC. 

Ananse follows in the tradition of most basic implementations by substituting mnemonics and shortened keywords for more verbose ones that makes program read in an english-like manner. 

The primary goal of the Ananse BASIC implementation is to provide an approachable first language for budding programmers. As such, whenever possible, costructs that sacrifice performance for simplicity will be adopted. It is the hope that the approachability of this language will also make it a first choice for developers who want a language for prototyping their ideas.


<!--BASIC was originally developed as a beginner friendly programming language in the late 1960's. The name BASIC itself, is a clever acronym for Beginners All Symbolic Instruction Code. When home computers were becoming a thing in the late 1970's and early 80's, most computers shipped wit basic pre-installed in ROM.-->
